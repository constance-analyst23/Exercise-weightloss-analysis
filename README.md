 # Exercise-weightloss-analysis
Data Analysis On Exercise Habit And Weight Management Using HHS and NHANES Datasets
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between exercise habits and weight management. Specifically, I wanted to see whether consistent physical activity contributes significantly to weight loss and maintenance, using both historical and recent health data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

2003 HHS Report â€“ baseline data on Americansâ€™ physical activity levels.

NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) â€“ current data on diet and physical activity.

Additional supporting datasets (if applicable) on calorie expenditure and BMI.

ðŸ”Ž Analysis & Methodology

Data Cleaning â€“ handled missing values, standardized units, and merged datasets for comparability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ used descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends in exercise frequency and BMI changes.

Comparative Analysis â€“ compared activity levels from 2003 to recent NHANES data to highlight trends over time.

Insights Extraction â€“ identified key correlations between exercise intensity, frequency, and weight outcomes.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Physical activity levels have remained relatively low since 2003, with only slight improvements.

Individuals meeting the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week were significantly more likely to maintain healthy weight.

Dietary habits combined with exercise produced stronger results than exercise alone.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Excel / Google Sheets (for preliminary exploration)

Power BI (for dashboard-style visualizations â€“ optional)

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Expand the analysis by including gender and age group differences.

Incorporate dietary intake factors (fiber, calcium, potassium) for a deeper understanding of the role of nutrition.

Create an interactive dashboard to make findings more accessible to non-technical audiences.
